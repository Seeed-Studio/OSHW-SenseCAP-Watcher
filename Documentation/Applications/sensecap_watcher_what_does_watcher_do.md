## Demo 1. Giving Directions to Visitors

In this application, we will explore how Watcher can be utilized to enhance the visitor experience, particularly in the context of guiding delivery personnel in a villa setting. By strategically placing two Watcher devices and configuring them with specific commands, we can create a seamless and efficient process for directing visitors and ensuring accurate package delivery.

### Step 1. Placement of the First Watcher

The first Watcher should be installed at the entrance of the villa, in a location that is easily visible to delivery personnel. This Watcher will serve as the initial point of contact, recognizing the presence of visitors carrying packages and providing them with clear instructions on where to deposit their deliveries.

### Step 2. Placement of the Second Watcher

The second Watcher should be positioned at the designated package storage area within the villa. This Watcher will be responsible for confirming the accurate placement of the packages and expressing gratitude to the delivery personnel for their service.

### Step 3. Configuring Commands for the First Watcher

Using the SenseCraft APP, issue the following command to the first Watcher:

**If someone is holding a parcel, please say, "Hello, courier parcels please take them to the table on the right, 3 metres straight ahead, thank you."**

This command ensures that the Watcher provides clear and concise directions to the delivery personnel, guiding them to the appropriate package storage area.

### Step 4. Configuring Commands for the Second Watcher

Using the SenseCraft APP, issue the following command to the second Watcher:

**If someone puts a parcel on the table, say "thank you".**

This command enables the second Watcher to acknowledge the successful placement of the package and express appreciation to the delivery personnel for their effort.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/watcher_getting_started/52.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Watcher Application #1 demonstrates how the strategic deployment of Watcher devices, combined with carefully crafted commands, can significantly enhance the visitor experience and streamline the package delivery process in a villa setting.

This application serves as a testament to the versatility and potential of Watcher as a physical AI agent, showcasing its ability to transform and optimize various aspects of our daily lives and interactions within intelligent spaces.

## Demo 2. The Virtual Cashier for Your Flower Shop

In this application, we will explore how Watcher can revolutionize the shopping experience in a flower shop by acting as a virtual cashier. By leveraging Watcher's object detection capabilities and the SenseCraft APP, we can create a seamless and efficient self-checkout process, enhancing customer experience and streamlining store operations.

### Step 1. Generating a Payment QR Code

Begin by generating a payment QR code using a platform like PayPal or other preferred payment providers. This QR code will serve as the key element in the self-checkout process, allowing customers to easily make payments for their flower purchases.

### Step 2. Uploading the QR Code to Watcher via SenseCraft APP

Access the SenseCraft APP and navigate to the **Animation** section. Locate the **Watching Space** and replace the existing animation with the generated payment QR code. This step ensures that Watcher will display the QR code when triggered, enabling a smooth self-checkout process.

### Step 3. Mounting Watcher on a Tripod

To ensure optimal performance and stability, mount Watcher on a tripod using a 1/4 Thread Tripod Bracket. This setup allows for easy adjustment of Watcher's position and angle, ensuring clear visibility of the checkout area.

### Step 4. Positioning Watcher at the Checkout Counter

Place the tripod-mounted Watcher at the checkout counter, facing the area where customers are expected to approach for payment. Ensure that Watcher has a clear view of the counter and can easily detect customers holding flowers.

### Step 5. Configuring Watcher's Task through SenseCraft APP

Using the SenseCraft APP, issue the following command to Watcher:

**When you detect a person holding flowers and facing you, say "Please scan the QR code to complete your purchase."**

This command instructs Watcher to monitor for customers holding flowers, display the uploaded payment QR code, and prompt them to initiate the self-checkout process by scanning the code.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/watcher_getting_started/53.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Step 6. Implementing the Self-Checkout Process

Upon detecting a customer holding flowers, Watcher will automatically display the payment QR code and trigger the pre-configured voice prompt, guiding the customer to scan the code for payment.

Once the customer scans the QR code, they will be directed to a mobile payment interface where they can complete the transaction using their preferred payment method.


Watcher Application #2 showcases the transformative potential of Watcher as a virtual cashier in a flower shop setting. By combining Watcher's object detection capabilities with the SenseCraft APP, flower shop owners can create a seamless and efficient self-checkout experience, enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing store operations.

As a physical AI agent, Watcher can be customized and configured to meet the specific needs of different businesses, driving innovation and improving the overall shopping experience.

## Demo 3. Your All-In-One Sensor -- fall detection, pet monitoring and lost property alert

In this application, we will explore the versatility and adaptability of Watcher as an all-in-one sensor solution, capable of handling a wide range of long-tail scenarios. By strategically placing multiple Watcher devices in different locations and configuring them to address specific situations, we can demonstrate Watcher's potential to enhance safety, security, and convenience in various settings.

### Scenario 1: Lost Property Alert in the Conference Room

Step 1: Mount the first Watcher on the conference room wall using a 360Â° Rotate Bracket, ensuring optimal coverage of the entire room.

Step 2: Using the SenseCraft APP, issue the following command to Watcher:

**When you detect that the conference room is empty and there is a computer on the table, send a notification to the app.**

This task enables Watcher to monitor the conference room and alert users through the app if any valuable property, such as a computer, is left unattended.

**If you detect a cat, play the audio message "Danger, please stay away"**

to deter the cat from approaching.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/watcher_getting_started/55.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>
