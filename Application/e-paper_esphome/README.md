So today I'm going to come in and do something else with some equipment I have on hand:

MCU: XIAO ESP32-S3

a 7.5â€™ waveshare ink screen

a 60GHz millimetre wave radar that can measure breathing and heart rate

an AI and LLM based behavioural monitoring device SenseCAP Watcher.

So I thought I'd start by displaying the dashboards of these little devices I have on hand that can access the Home Assistant, on the ink screen.

That way, when my equipment arrives one by one, I can start applying these steps to display the sensor values that are necessary to observe on the ink screen.

I spent the whole day and got the following result.
